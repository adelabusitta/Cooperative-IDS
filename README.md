#Cooperative IDS
Cloud systems are becoming more complex and
vulnerable to attacks. Cyber attacks are also becoming more
sophisticated and harder to detect. Therefore, it is increasingly
difficult for a single cloud-based intrusion detection system
(IDS) to detect all attacks, because of limited and incomplete
knowledge about attacks. The recent researches in cyber-security
have shown that a cooperation among IDSs can bring higher
detection accuracy in such complex computer systems. Through
collaboration, a cloud-based IDS can consult other IDSs about
suspicious intrusions and increase the decision accuracy. The
problem of existing cooperative IDS approaches is that they
overlook having untrusted (malicious or not) IDSs that may
negatively effect the decision about suspicious intrusions in the
cloud. Moreover, they rely on a centralized architecture in which
a central agent regulates the cooperation, which contradicts the
distributed nature of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a framework
that enables IDSs to distributively form trustworthy IDSs
communities. We devise an algorithm, based on cooperative game
theory, that allows a set of cloud-based IDSs to cooperatively set
up their coalition in such a way to make their individual detection
accuracy increase, even in the presence of untrusted IDSs.
